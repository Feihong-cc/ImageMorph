=============================
=  Description of program   =
=============================

This program creates a sequence morphing from one image
to another. It recives from the user matching points on both source and
target image, and fills both images with triangles according to those points,
with each point the edge of a triangle, thus filling the entire screen. Each
two new point the user marks must be inside two corresponding triangles on the
source and target.

The program then creates a series of images, with each image in line 
presenting a change from the source image to the target image, thus creating
a morphing sequence.
 
Using the program gui.py, which uses ex7.py, will enable a user to select
points on both source and target images, display the relevant triangles and 
execute the morphing process.

====================
=  Usage for ex7 =
====================

python3 gui.py <image_source> <image_target> <num_frames> <out_dir> \
<max_x> <max_y>

Alternatly the program can be run without values:
python3 gui.py

In this case these default values will be used:
image_source = im1.jpg
image_target = im2.jpg
num_frames = 40
out_dir = "images"
max_x = 500
may_y = 350
